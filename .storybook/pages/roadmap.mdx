# Roadmap

This is the roadmap for Bedrock Layout. It is subject to change as we get feedback from the community. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

If you're updating an existing app, start with the [Migration Guide](/?path=/docs/overview-migration-guide--docs).

## Completed Breaking Changes

These breaking changes are already reflected in the current API:

- [x] Remove deprecated components and hooks in React and Solid
  - [x] `MasonryGrid`
  - [x] `PadBox`
  - [x] `AppBoundary`
  - [x] `useForwardedRef`(moved to another repo)
  - [x] `useResizeObserver`(moved to another repo)
  - [x] `useContainerQuery`(moved to another repo)
  - [x] `useStatefulRef`(moved to another repo)
  - [x] `register-resize-callback`(moved to another repo)
- [x] Remove the `center-children` prop from the `Center` component
- [x] Remove the `columns` prop from `Columns` in favor of `colCount`
- [x] Remove the `gutter` prop in favor of `gap`
- [x] Replace `noStretchColumns` with `variant="centered"` on `ColumnDrop`
- [x] Replace `stretchContent` with `variant="stretch-content"` on `Cover`
- [x] Use `CoverCentered` instead of `top` and `bottom` props for `Cover`
- [x] Switch all public API custom properties to kebab-case (e.g. `--min-item-width`)
- [x] Switch `Inline` and `InlineCluster` default alignment to `center`
- [x] Replace `data-bedrock-*` with `data-br-*`

## Planned Breaking Changes

These items are under consideration for a future major release:

- [x] Change default widths for components to be `100%` instead of specific widths/heights
- [x] Removed the `ThemeProvider` component and related theme hooks
- [x] Allow spacing constants to be shared between React and Solid with a non-semver release cadence

**Note:** The breaking changes will be released in a major version bump, so you will need to update your code to use the new version of the library. Also those items marked with a checkmark (deprecation items) have already been implemented and are available in the latest version of the library.

## Non-breaking Changes

The following are some of the non-breaking changes that are planned for the next version of the library. The items marked with a checkmark have already been implemented and are available in the latest version of the library.

- [x] Add support for the "-br-" in the attributes e.g,. `data-br-grid` or `data-br-stack` instead of `data-bedrock-grid` or `data-bedrock-stack`
- [x] Add `variant:masonry` to grid in both CSS and react/solid
- [x] Add support for `gap` prop
- [x] Add support for `colCount` prop
- [x] Add support for the `variant:centered` prop for the `ColumnDrop` component to replace the `noStretchColumns` prop
- [x] Add support for the `variant:stretch-content` prop for the `Cover` component to replace the `stretchContent` prop
- [x] Add support for size props in CSS strings e.g., `data-br-grid="minItemWidth:sizeContent3"`
- [x] Add alignment props to stack component
- [x] add support for space-around for inline and inline cluster
- [x] Add support for Kebab case on custom properties

## Documentation Improvements

- [ ] Add more examples
- [ ] Update lessons to use React + Vite instead of create-react-app (probably in conjunction with breaking changes)
- [ ] Add more use cases
- [x] Add a migration guide to Storybook
