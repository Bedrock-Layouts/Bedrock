# The Hero

A common landing page feature is the "Hero" layout. A Hero tends to be the first thing a user sees on a page, and is the most important thing to focus on. It is usually has a large image and/or heading, a short description of the page, and one or more call to actions.

The Hero layout is easily achieved using the [`Cover`](/?path=/docs/wrapper-components-cover--api) component.

## Building a Hero

Let's start by stubbing out the markup we'll need. In our `App.js` file, let's make the following changes:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";
import { Inline } from "@bedrock-layout/inline";

import { Subscribe } from "./Subscribe";
import { Menu } from "./Menu";

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter='size3'>
      <Menu />
      <Stack as="header" gutter='size3'>
        <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
        <p>Elegant Feminine Fashion</p>
        <Inline gutter='size3'>
          <button>New Arrivals</button>
        </Inline>
      </Stack>
      <Subscribe />
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your browser should now show something like this:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={heroPageInitial}
    alt="The landing page before the hero layout styles have been applied."
  />
</Center>

The Cover component is a wrapper component that will vertically center it's content. It also let's you optionally render an item on above and/or below the content.

So let's start by downloading the Cover component:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/cover
```

And then we'll update our `App.js` file to look like this:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";
import { Inline } from "@bedrock-layout/inline";
import { Cover } from "@bedrock-layout/cover";

import { Subscribe } from "./Subscribe";
import { Menu } from "./Menu";

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter='size3'>
      <Cover minHeight="50vh" gutter='size3' top={<Menu />}>
        <Stack as="header" gutter='size3'>
          <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
          <p>Elegant Feminine Fashion</p>
          <Inline gutter='size3'>
            <button>New Arrivals</button>
          </Inline>
        </Stack>
      </Cover>
      <Subscribe />
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your browser should now show the following:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={heroPageWithCover}
    alt="The landing page with the hero layout styles have been applied."
  />
</Center>

## Adding the Center component

Let's address so width problems our website is having. Both our `Subscribe` component and header take up the entire width of their containers. This isn't ideal. Optimally, we want them to be stop growing after a certain width and then remain centered in their parent container. To do this, let's add the [`Center`](/?path=/docs/wrapper-components-center--api) component to our `App.js` file. First, we need to install it:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/center
```

Then we can add it to our `App.js` file:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";
import { Inline } from "@bedrock-layout/inline";
import { Cover } from "@bedrock-layout/cover";
import { Center } from "@bedrock-layout/center";

import { Subscribe } from "./Subscribe";
import { Menu } from "./Menu";

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter='size3'>
      <Cover minHeight="50vh" gutter='size3' top={<Menu />}>
        <Center maxWidth="40rem">
          <Stack as="header" gutter='size3'>
            <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
            <p>Elegant Feminine Fashion</p>
            <Inline gutter='size3'>
              <button>New Arrivals</button>
            </Inline>
          </Stack>
        </Center>
      </Cover>
      <Center centerText>
        <Subscribe />
      </Center>
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your browser should now show the following:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={heroPageWithCenter}
    alt="The landing page with the hero layout and center styles have been applied."
  />
</Center>

## AppBoundary

When we think of responsive design, we typically think of phones and tablets. However, screen resolutions are getting larger and larger. Allowing our page to grow to the same width as a 4K monitor is irresponsible. A website typically will want to clamp at an outer limit and stay centered on the screen.

The `AppBoundary` is built on the `Center` component and is designed to wrap your entire app. By default, it will clamp the width at the `1920px`, which is the `xxlarge` size option. This can also be set via the `boundarySize` prop to any of the valid size options.

Let's start by installing the `AppBoundary` primitive:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/appboundary
```

Then we can update our `index.js` file to use the `AppBoundary` primitive:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import { AppBoundary } from "@bedrock-layout/appboundary";
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <AppBoundary boundarySize="xlarge">
      <App />
    </AppBoundary>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now the `AppBoundary` will clamp the width of your app to the `xlarge` size option, or `1439px`.

Our landing page is coming along. In the next section, we'll be building cards and add them to a responsive grid layout.

<Inline switchAt="25rem" stretch={1} gutter="size3" minItemWidth="fit-content">
  <Button
    as="a"
    href="/?path=/docs/getting-started-lesson-4-the-menu-component--docs"
  >
    <Intl>The Menu Component</Intl>
  </Button>
  <span />
  <Button
    as="a"
    href="/?path=/docs/getting-started-lesson-6-the-new-arrivals--docs"
  >
    <Intl>The New Arrivals</Intl>
  </Button>
</Inline>
