# The New Arrivals

A UI pattern that is very popular in the web development world is to have a set of cards that are displayed in a grid-like layout. These cards might be products, blog posts, or anything else that you want to promote. Cards often have a cover image, a title, and a description, but they also come in many varieties.

## Building a Card Component

Let's start by creating a `Card` component with some basic markup. In our `src` directory, create a new file called `Card.js` and paste the following code into it.:

```jsx
export function Card() {
  return (
    <article>
      <img
        src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/900×700/?fruit"
        alt="A random fruit from unsplash.com"
      />
      <h3>Fruit</h3>
      <p>
        Est autem etiam actio quaedam corporis, quae motus et status naturae
        congruentis tenet;
      </p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Now we can bring in this component into our `App.js` file. In our `App.js` file, paste the following code into the `App.js` file:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";
import { Inline } from "@bedrock-layout/inline";
import { Cover } from "@bedrock-layout/cover";
import { Center } from "@bedrock-layout/center";

import { Subscribe } from "./Subscribe";
import { Menu } from "./Menu";
import { Card } from "./Card";

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter='size3'>
      <Cover minHeight="50vh" gutter='size3' top={<Menu />}>
        <Center maxWidth="40rem">
          <Stack as="header" gutter='size3'>
            <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
            <p>Elegant Feminine Fashion</p>
            <Inline gutter='size3'>
              <button>New Arrivals</button>
            </Inline>
          </Stack>
        </Center>
      </Cover>
      <Stack gutter='size7'>
        <h2>New Arrivals</h2>
        <Card />
      </Stack>
      <Center centerText>
        <Subscribe />
      </Center>
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your browser should now show something like this:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={cardInitial}
    alt="The landing page with a New Arrivals showing a single card with no layout styling."
  />
</Center>

Typically in a card we want to do two things. One, we often want to set the image's aspect-ratio to fit the design, croping the image so that it fits in the desired aspect ratio. The other thing we typically want to do is add padding around the either the text or the whole card itself. To accomplish these two goals, we can use the `Frame` and the `PadBox` primitives.

So let's start by downloading the the `Frame` and the `PadBox` primitives:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/frame @bedrock-layout/padbox
```

And then let's update our `Card.js` file to look like this:

```jsx
import { Frame } from "@bedrock-layout/frame";
import { PadBox } from "@bedrock-layout/padbox";
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";

//simulate text of various lengths
function randomLoremIpsum() {
  const string =
    "Est autem etiam actio quaedam corporis, quae motus et status naturae congruentis tenet;";

  return Array.from(
    { length: Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1) },
    () => string
  ).join(" ");
}

export function Card({ title }) {
  return (
    <Stack as="article" gutter='size3'>
      <Frame ratio={[16, 9]}>
        <img
          src={`https://source.unsplash.com/random/900×700/?${title}`}
          alt="A random fruit from unsplash.com"
        />
      </Frame>
      <PadBox padding="size5">
        <h3>{title}</h3>
        <p>{randomLoremIpsum()}</p>
      </PadBox>
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

Now are Card takes a `title` prop and displays a `title` and a random image based off of that title. It will also generate a random lorem ipsum as the text.

now we can update our `App.js` file to add a `Fruit` to the `title` prop of the `Card` component and see what happens:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={cardStyled}
    alt="The card now with the layout styles having been applied."
  />
</Center>

## A Grid of Cards

We have a `Card` component that we can use to display a card. Now we want to display them in a grid. There are a few options for this using Bedrock Layout Primitives. The correct one depends upon the type of layout you want to use. Let's try all 3 options and you can decide which option you like the best.

First, we will need to install the `ColumnDrop`, the `Grid`, and the `MasonryGrid` components:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/column-drop @bedrock-layout/grid @bedrock-layout/masonry-grid
```

Let's start by adding the `ColumnDrop` component to our `App.js` file:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";
import { Inline } from "@bedrock-layout/inline";
import { Cover } from "@bedrock-layout/cover";
import { Center } from "@bedrock-layout/center";
import { ColumnDrop } from "@bedrock-layout/column-drop";

import { Subscribe } from "./Subscribe";
import { Menu } from "./Menu";
import { Card } from "./Card";

const cards = ["Fruit", "Bikes", "Clothes", "Shoes", "Computers"];

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter='size3'>
      <Cover minHeight="50vh" gutter='size3' top={<Menu />}>
        <Center maxWidth="40rem">
          <Stack as="header" gutter='size3'>
            <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
            <p>Elegant Feminine Fashion</p>
            <Inline gutter='size3'>
              <button>New Arrivals</button>
            </Inline>
          </Stack>
        </Center>
      </Cover>
      <Center>
        <Stack gutter='size7'>
          <h2>New Arrivals</h2>
          <ColumnDrop gutter='size3' minItemWidth="20rem">
            {cards.map((title) => (
              <Card key={title} title={title} />
            ))}
          </ColumnDrop>
        </Stack>
      </Center>
      <Center centerText>
        <Subscribe />
      </Center>
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your browser should now show the following:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={columnDrop}
    alt="The landing page with cards in a column drop layout."
  />
</Center>

The above picture show the cards being optimized to the number of columns that fit the container, based on the `minItemWidth` set on the `ColumnDrop` component. When a column drops down to a new row, the precious row's column count does not impact the new row's column count. By default, it will stretch each card, but you can also set the `ColumnDrop` to have `noStretchedColumns` set to `true` to prevent this.

The next option is to use the `Grid` component. So let's update our `App.js` file to use the `Grid` component. We will also need to import the `Grid` component

```jsx
import { Grid } from "@bedrock-layout/grid";
```

Then we can update replace the `ColumnDrop` component with the `Grid` component:

```jsx
<Grid gutter='size3' minItemWidth="20rem">
  {cards.map((title) => (
    <Card key={title} title={title} />
  ))}
</Grid>
```

Your browser should now show the following:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={grid}
    alt="The landing page with cards in a grid layout."
  />
</Center>

Unlike the `ColumnDrop` the Grid will keep a consistent column count across rows. The column count is based on the `minItemWidth` set on the `Grid` component.

The final option is to use the `MasonryGrid` component. So let's update our `App.js` file to use the `MasonryGrid` component. We will also need to import the `MasonryGrid` component,

```jsx
import { MasonryGrid } from "@bedrock-layout/masonry-grid";
```

Then we can update replace the `Grid` component with the `MasonryGrid` component:

```jsx
<MasonryGrid gutter='size3' minItemWidth="20rem">
  {cards.map((title) => (
    <Card key={title} title={title} />
  ))}
</MasonryGrid>
```

Your browser should now show the following:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={masonryGrid}
    alt="The landing page with cards in a masonry grid layout."
  />
</Center>

The `MasonryGrid` component will keep a consistent column count across rows. But instead of vertically stretching each card, to fit the tallest card in the row, it will keep the cards height the same. Then each card is placed as densly as possible. This layout pattern is often called the `Pintrest` layout since it is made popular by Pinterest.

It's important to note that all three grid layouts will optimize based on it's container, eventually creating a stacking layout when the container is too small. The difference between the three layouts is how the columns and rows are distributed.

## What Next?

In just a few short lessons we now a well laid out landing page. You can see the power of how easy it is to create so many complicated layouts with these simple layout primitives. I recomend you check out the rest of the Bedrock Layout Primitives. Also check out the [CSS only version of the Bedrock Layout Primitives](/docs/css-only-a-css-only-version--docs) in case you are interested in using them in a project that is not using React.

If you are interested in contributing you can learn more about [contributing code to Bedrock](/docs/overview-contributing--docs) or [you can open an issue any time at the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Bedrock-Layouts/Bedrock/issues).

Thank you again for taking the time to learn more about Bedrock Layout Primitives. I hope you enjoyed it.
