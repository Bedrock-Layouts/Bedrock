# CSS Reset

A CSS Reset that complements the Bedrock Layout Primitives beautifully.

## About the Reset

This CSS reset is **optional** but highly recommended if you're using Bedrock Layout. It removes default browser styles and inconsistencies across different browsers, providing a clean foundation for your layout primitives to work on. The reset normalizes spacing, typography, and element behavior, making your layouts more predictable and consistent across all platforms.

## Installation

The reset is not included in the main CSS bundle, so you will need to import it individually at the start of your application:

```javascript
import "@bedrock-layout/css/lib/reset.min.css";
```

We recommend importing the reset before importing the main Bedrock Layout CSS:

```javascript
import "@bedrock-layout/css/lib/reset.min.css";
import "@bedrock-layout/css/lib/bedrock-layout.min.css";
```

## Why Use It?

The reset ensures:

- Consistent default margins and padding across all elements
- Proper line-height and font sizing
- Normalized form elements and buttons
- Consistent box-sizing model
- Predictable overflow handling

When combined with Bedrock Layout primitives, this reset allows you to focus on layout and design without worrying about browser defaults interfering with your component styling.
