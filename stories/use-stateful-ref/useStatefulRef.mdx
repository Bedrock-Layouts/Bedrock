# useStatefulRef

React RefObjects are not stateful, or in other words, changing the `current` property on the RefObject doesn't trigger a rerender.
One can use a ref callback to updated state, but now we are no longer using RefObjects and there is great power in consistency and knowing we will be getting a
RefObject every time. `useStatefulRef` will return a RefObject that can be passed around and used just like any other RefObject, except that changes to the `current`
property will trigger a rerender just like updating state.

## Use case

Anytime you want a RefObject that will trigger a rerender when the `current` property is updated

## How to install

```bash
  npm install @bedrock-layout/use-stateful-ref
```

## Basic usage

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const ref = useStatefulRef(null);
  //... Use the ref object will trigger a rerender
  return <Div ref={ref}>{...content}</Div>;
};
```
